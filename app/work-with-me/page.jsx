              Sometimes a family doesn&apos;t need a talk or an audience &mdash; they want to think
              through what&apos;s happening with their own kid. I take on a small amount of
              one-on-one coaching for parents who want direct, personal help with a specific
              season.
            </p>
            <p>
              A few sessions to step back, name what&apos;s really going on, and leave with a plan
              that fits your house.

              <strong>Fourteen years</strong> in a middle-school classroom left me with a story for
