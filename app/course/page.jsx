  },
  {
    n: '02', q: 'Is this self-paced, or do I need to keep up with a group?',
    a: "Self-paced. The lessons are yours on your own schedule, with lifetime access — take them in a nap window or after bedtime, watch or listen. There's also a monthly live office hour with Sean if you want to bring a real situation to a teacher: come to all of them, none of them, or whichever ones fit your month.",
  },
  {
    n: '03', q: "We've tried therapy. How is this different?",
    a: "Therapy works on your kid. This works on you — specifically on how you show up in the moments that count. They're not in competition. Many families do both.",
  },
  {
    n: '04', q: 'How is this different from your free content?',
    a: "The free posts are one idea at a time. Middle Skills is the whole thing, in order — six modules, 18 lessons, the worksheets and scripts, and the audio version of every lesson. The free content is the front door. The course is the house.",
  },
  {
    n: '05', q: "I don't have hours to watch a course.",
    a: "Each module is broken into short lessons you can take in a single nap window or after bedtime — and every lesson also comes as a podcast-style audio episode, so you can listen on a commute, a walk, or the school run instead of watching. The full curriculum is roughly 90 minutes per module; you don't have to take it all at once.",
  },
  {
    n: '06', q: "My partner isn't on board — will this still work?",
    a: "Yes. It's designed so one parent can run the framework even if the other isn't doing it. The moves that work don't require a unified front — they require one parent who understands what they're looking at.",
  },
  {
    n: '07', q: "My kid doesn't have ADHD or any diagnosis — is this still for us?",
    a: "Yes. Middle Skills is built for the developmental reality of ages 9–15, not for any specific diagnosis. If your kid is in the middle years and something has shifted, this is for you.",
  },
  {
    n: '08', q: 'What age range is this for?',
    a: "9 to 15 — the middle years. Some content scales slightly above and below, but the core curriculum is built for this specific developmental window. And what you learn here doesn't expire when they turn 16: the way you communicate, repair, and show up will serve your relationship with your child for the rest of your lives.",
  },
  {
    n: '09', q: 'Is there a refund policy?',
    a: "Yes — 30 days, no questions, no funnels. Complete the first module, and if it isn't useful, write me and I'll send your money back the same day.",

    n: '10', q: 'Can my school or parent group buy it together?',
    a: null,
    aJsx: true,

  {
    n: '11', q: 'Is Sean actually an expert?',
    a: "Fourteen years as a middle school teacher — watching thousands of kids move through this exact developmental stage — and a dad of three sons currently in the middle years. He's not theorizing. He's teaching from the classroom and the kitchen table at once.",

            Each module is roughly 90 minutes of video, or audio format, across three lessons.
            Plus resources and reference materials you&rsquo;ll actually use. Every one is built
            around concrete behaviors for parents and kids, not vague ideas.

              Fourteen years as a middle school teacher &mdash; watching thousands of kids move
              through this exact developmental window. Not in a book. In the room, every day, seeing
              what worked and what didn&rsquo;t and why.

            <p>
              When his own sons hit the middle years, he noticed something uncomfortable: he was a
              better teacher than he was a dad. The skills he used all day with other people&rsquo;s
              kids &mdash; the ones that reached even the toughest students &mdash; he simply
              wasn&rsquo;t using at home. So he started. They worked at the kitchen table just like
              they worked in the classroom. Middle Skills is those tools, built for parents.

              The developmental window is real &mdash; and how you navigate the next three or four
              years shapes how your kid walks out of adolescence. That&rsquo;s not meant to scare
              you. It&rsquo;s meant to be honest:{' '}
              <em>showing up differently now matters.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              You can wait it out. A lot of parents do. But &ldquo;the phase&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a
              strategy, and the distance that opens up in these years doesn&rsquo;t always close on
              its own. Every hard moment is either a wall you build or a door you learn to open.
