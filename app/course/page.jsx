  {
    n: '02', q: 'Is this self-paced, or do I need to keep up with a group?',
    a: "Self-paced. The lessons are yours on your own schedule, with lifetime access — take them in a nap window or after bedtime, watch or listen. There's also a monthly live office hour with Sean if you want to bring a real situation to a teacher: come to all of them, none of them, or whichever ones fit your month.",
  },
  {
    n: '03', q: "We've tried therapy. How is this different?",
    a: "Therapy works on your kid. This works on you — specifically on how you show up in the moments that count. They're not in competition. Many families do both.",
  },
  {
    n: '04', q: 'How is this different from your free content?',
    a: "The free posts are one idea at a time. Middle Skills is the whole thing, in order — six modules, 18 lessons, the worksheets and scripts, and the audio version of every lesson. The free content is the front door. The course is the house.",
  },
  {
    n: '05', q: "I don't have the time to watch a course.",
    a: "We know. Each module is broken into 3 lessons that you can complete in a week. Around 90 minutes per module, 30 minutes per lesson. Every lesson comes with video and podcast-style audio for the car or the gym. And for every robust written resource, there are key points, frameworks and summary documents to reference. The course is designed so you can use the pieces you need, when you need, as you go.",
  },
  {
    n: '06', q: "My partner isn't on board — will this still work?",
    a: "Yes. It's designed so one parent can run the framework even if the other isn't doing it. The moves that work don't require a unified front — they require one parent who understands what they're looking at.",
  },
  {
    n: '07', q: "My kid doesn't have ADHD or any diagnosis — is this still for us?",
    a: "Yes. Middle Skills is built for the developmental reality of ages 9–15, not for any specific diagnosis. If your kid is in the middle years and something has shifted, this is for you.",
  },
  {
    n: '08', q: 'What age range is this for?',
    a: "9 to 15 — the middle years. Some content scales slightly above and below, but the core curriculum is built for this specific developmental window. And what you learn here doesn't expire when they turn 16: the way you communicate, repair, and show up will serve your relationship with your child for the rest of your lives.",
  },
  {
    n: '09', q: 'Is there a refund policy?',
    a: "Yes — 30 days, no questions, no funnels. Complete the first module, and if it isn't useful, write me and I'll send your money back the same day.",

    aJsx: true,

  {
    n: '11', q: 'Is Sean actually an expert?',
    a: "Fourteen years as a middle school teacher — watching thousands of kids move through this exact developmental stage — and a dad of three sons currently in the middle years. He's not theorizing. He's teaching from the classroom and the kitchen table at once.",

            <p>
              The early adolescent brain isn&rsquo;t breaking down. It&rsquo;s being rebuilt.
              Between 9 and 15, neural pathways prune and rewire on a scale matched by few other
              periods of life. Impulse control, empathy, long-term thinking, social skills are all
              under construction. Not metaphorically, neurologically.

            <p>
              What looks like defiance is often autonomy taking shape. What looks like withdrawal is
              resilience being tested. What looks like overreaction is an emotional system still being
              built. Your kid isn&rsquo;t broken or behind. They&rsquo;re doing the developmental
              work this stage requires.

            <p>
              With the architecture in view and your kid&rsquo;s work in focus, you can stop fighting
              the wrong battle and start teaching the skills the moment is built for. This is the

              Fourteen years as a middle school teacher &mdash; watching thousands of kids move
              through this exact developmental window. Not in a book. In the room, every day, seeing
              what worked and what didn&rsquo;t and why.
            </p>
            <p>
              When his own sons hit the middle years, he noticed something uncomfortable: he was a
              better teacher than he was a dad. The skills he used all day with other people&rsquo;s
              kids &mdash; the ones that reached even the toughest students &mdash; weren&rsquo;t
              always working at home. So he&rsquo;s building the bridge between the spaces.
              Connecting what teachers and psychologists know to what parents do. Using his passion
              to teach people and help kids to facilitate progressive change for families.

              The developmental window is real &mdash; and how you navigate the next three or four
              years shapes how your kid walks out of adolescence. That&rsquo;s not meant to scare
              you. It&rsquo;s meant to be honest:{' '}
              <em>showing up differently now matters.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              You can wait it out. A lot of parents do. But &ldquo;the phase&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a
              strategy, and the distance that opens up in these years doesn&rsquo;t always close on
              its own. Every hard moment is either a wall you build or a door you learn to open.
